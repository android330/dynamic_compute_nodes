# dynamic_compute_nodes
This is a a test change

There could be a great deal f progress that could be done if we use docker with a mounted volume
Consider that all nodes are loaded with a common server or machine and then we simply have
any and all services work on the mounted volume. At a loss of power then the node naively sends
all files in the volume to the next node and so on.
